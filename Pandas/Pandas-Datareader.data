#The DataReader function takes 4 arguments:

    #'MORTGAGE30US' - An identifier provided by the API specifying the data we want back, in this case 30 year mortgage data in the US
    #'fred' - The name of the API we want to access
    #start_date, end_date - The date range we want the data to be from

#The start and end dates are special data types called datetimes, which can be created using the Python datetime module.
